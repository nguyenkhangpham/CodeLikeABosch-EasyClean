# EasyClean: The Smart Handheld Vacuum Cleaner Extension for Bosch EasyDrill 12

## How Does It Work?

The operating principle is simple: attach EasyClean's rotor to the drill's chuck, connect the Arduino circuit to the drill's charging port, and you have a fully operational handheld vacuum cleaner at the push of a button.

## Hardware Components

1. Tubing System: Features a centrifugal propeller design optimized for efficient suction.
2. Suction Nozzles: Interchangeable to suit different surfaces.
3. Control Panel: Houses LED indicators and buttons for manual operation.
4. Attachment Mechanism: Equipped with a secure latch for easy and firm attachment to the Bosch EasyDrill 12.
All of these components are 3D-printable, using PLA for prototypes and either ABS or PETG for the final version.

## Smart Features

EasyClean is more than just a vacuum cleaner; it's a smart device. With an Arduino Nano at its heart, and sensors to measure pressure and efficiency, EasyClean can connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth. This allows real-time monitoring of the vacuum's performance and any troubleshooting issues.

## Power & Efficiency

The project is designed for minimal power consumption. We optimized the rotor blades and tubing system to consume just 5% of the Bosch drill's total power. This means you can vacuum for an extended period without depleting the drill's battery. Our calculations indicate an estimated runtime of approximately 20 minutes, which is quite impressive for a device of this size.

## Environmental & Cost Impact

The use of 3D-printable materials makes this an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution. The estimated material cost for the 3D-printed parts is relatively low, making EasyClean an affordable upgrade for Bosch EasyDrill 12 users.

## Why EasyClean?

- Versatility: Not just a drill anymore; now also a handy vacuum cleaner.
- Convenience: Easy to attach, easy to use, easy to monitor.
- Efficiency: Optimized for low power consumption.
- Affordability: Low-cost materials and utilizes your existing drill.

## How We Make Money?

1. Selling Kits: We sell the EasyClean kit online and in stores.
2. App Features: You can pay a small fee for extra features in the mobile app.

##  Who Needs This?

Anyone who already owns a Bosch EasyDrill 12 and wants it to do more. We think we can get 1 out of every 5 current owners interested in the first year.

## What It Costs?

1. Start-up Costs: About €5,000 for research, prototypes, and the mobile app.
2. Making One Unit: Costs around €20 for the parts.
3. Selling Price: We plan to sell it for about €40-50, so we make some profit.

We aim to give Bosch EasyDrill 12 users a handy and affordable way to do more with a tool they already own.

In summary, EasyClean is not merely an attachment; it's an upgrade. It brings value to your Bosch EasyDrill 12 by adding a new layer of functionality, making your drill a more versatile tool than ever before.
